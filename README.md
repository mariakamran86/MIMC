**Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause (MIMIC) Model with Discrete Indicators**

*Maria Kamran*

This repository is intended for users who want to implement multiple-indicator, multiple-cause (MIMIC) modelling with discrete indicators in R. The potential target group includes advanced undergraduate students in technical fields, such as statistics or economics, graduate students in social sciences and engineering who are devising their own estimators, and researchers and practitioners. 

The functions given in file maxLik_1.R are described in the pdf document titled Manual. To use the functions one should have a basic knowledge of the R language and be familiar with the concepts of likelihood and maximum likelihood. If you are not familiar with these concepts, please refer to the R vignette, "Maximum Likelihood Estimation with maxLik".
